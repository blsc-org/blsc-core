# Grants & Funding Overview  
### Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC)

This document outlines how the Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC) aligns with the structure, terminology, and expectations of typical funding programmes, including Horizon Europe, CORDIS, Digital Europe, national AI initiatives, and digital heritage programmes.

## 1. Project Summary

- **Project Title:** Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC)  
- **Type:** Open Research Infrastructure / Language Resource  
- **Domain:** NLP • AI • Digital Humanities • Cultural Heritage  
- **Scope:** National-scale corpus of contemporary and historical Bulgarian texts, paired with tools for standardised linguistic processing.  
- **Primary Beneficiaries:**  
  Researchers, universities, schools, cultural institutions, AI developers, linguists, digital humanists, and the Bulgarian public.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Bulgarian is critically underrepresented in modern NLP and AI ecosystems.  
There is no unified, public, legally compliant, large-scale corpus that can be used for:

- training language models,
- academic research,
- digital preservation,
- creating tools for Bulgarian speakers,
- educational purposes.

This creates dependency on foreign datasets and leads to:

- inaccurate Bulgarian LLMs,
- poor machine translation,
- weak linguistic tools,
- limited academic output,
- fragmentation across institutions.

---

## 3. Objectives (Horizon Europe Format)

The BLSC initiative is structured around four core objectives:

### **OBJ1 – Preservation & Digitisation**  
Create a legally compliant digital repository of Bulgarian written heritage, including public domain literature, journalism, academic writing, legal texts, and historical manuscripts (where permitted).

### **OBJ2 – Standardisation & Metadata**  
Develop unified standards for corpus structure, metadata schemas, encoding, annotation, and long-term reproducibility.

### **OBJ3 – NLP Tools & Automations**  
Provide open-source tooling (tokenisers, sentence splitters, taggers, normalisers, evaluation sets) supporting downstream NLP and AI tasks.

### **OBJ4 – Integration, Education & Open Science**  
Promote open access, community contribution, university participation, and full transparency in data, tools, and documentation.

## 6. Legal, Ethical & Open Science Principles

The project strictly adheres to:

- **copyright law** – only public domain or open-licensed texts;
- **privacy protection** – no personal data, no restricted scraping;
- **transparency** – open documentation of sources and transformations;
- **open science** – tools and datasets released under MIT / CC compatible licenses;
- **reproducibility** – stable structure, metadata schemas, and version tracking.

- Bulgarian Academy of Sciences  
- National Library “St. Cyril and St. Methodius”  
- Regional libraries and archives (public domain materials)  
- AI research groups  
- Open-source NLP communities  
- International digital heritage initiatives
