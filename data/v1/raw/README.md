# raw/ — Original Source Texts (Unmodified)

This folder contains the original, unmodified Bulgarian texts collected for the BLSC v1 dataset.
Files placed here must preserve the exact source form:
- no corrections,
- no normalization,
- no preprocessing.

Each text must have a corresponding metadata file in `metadata/` with the same base filename.
