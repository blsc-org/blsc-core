This project acknowledges the inspiration and early conceptual contributions of **Emil Neshkov**, whose interest in language, technology, and digital culture helped shape the initial direction of the Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC).

The project is built and maintained as an open, community-driven initiative, independent of any private or institutional affiliation. Its evolution is the result of the shared effort of contributors who support the long-term development of Bulgarian language resources.
