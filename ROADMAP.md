# BLSC Roadmap (2025–2030)
This roadmap outlines the planned development phases, milestones, and strategic objectives of the Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC).  
It provides a long-term vision for establishing a comprehensive, standardized and community-driven resource for Bulgarian NLP, linguistics, and digital humanities.

---

##  Phase 1: Foundation (2024–2025)
### Goals
- Establish the BLSC organization (`blsc-org`) on GitHub.
- Define standards, directory structure, and documentation.
- Publish the **core dataset specification**.
- Create bilingual documentation (`README.md`, `README_BG.md`).
- Set up contribution guidelines and governance documents.
- Add initial sample datasets (public domain).
- Prepare structure compatible with EU funding programs.

### Deliverables
- `blsc-core` repository
- Metadata schema
- Basic validation scripts
- Logo and identity package
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `FUNDING.md`, `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`

---

##  Phase 2: Expansion (2026–2027)
### Goals
- Mass collection and categorization of Bulgarian texts.
- Create dedicated repositories for specific corpus modules:
  - journalism & news  
  - literature (public domain)  
  - legal & administrative texts  
  - scientific writing  
  - web corpus  
  - user-generated content  
- Begin development of NLP tools:
  - tokenizer  
  - sentence splitter  
  - morphological tagger  
  - normalization utilities  

### Deliverables
- Several new public repositories under `blsc-org`
- Automated tools for dataset cleaning and segmentation
- Initial NLP preprocessing toolkit
- Beta version of the **Historical & Archival Collection**

---

##  Phase 3: Consolidation & National Expansion (2027–2028)
### Goals
- Grow the corpus to a national-scale linguistic resource.
- Build connections with:
  - universities  
  - archives  
  - the Institute for Bulgarian Language  
  - cultural institutions  
- Improve tools for:
  - metadata verification  
  - OCR correction  
  - long-form text normalization  
- Prepare dataset bundles for model training (LM, GPT-style, BERT-style).

### Deliverables
- Stable metadata standard (v2)
- Release of evaluation sets for NLP benchmarks
- Integration with global linguistic repositories (CLARIN, ELRA)
- First academic publications/results referencing BLSC

---

##  Phase 4: AI Integration & Research Infrastructure (2028–2029)
### Goals
- Provide full datasets suitable for:
  - pre-training LLMs  
  - fine-tuning specialized models  
  - linguistic research  
- Build tools for:
  - dataset slicing  
  - domain filtering  
  - controlled vocabulary expansion  
- Create institutional collaborations and grant-based partnerships.

### Deliverables
- “BLSC-LM-pretrain” datasets (multi-billion token scale)
- Automated pipelines for dataset updates
- Web portal (optional future expansion)

---

##  Phase 5: Sustainability & Long-Term Governance (2029–2030)
### Goals
- Establish long-term maintenance governance.
- Create yearly update cycles.
- Ensure compatibility with international standards.
- Secure sustainable funding (public, academic, NGO, industry).

### Deliverables
- Stable dataset versions and regular releases
- Governance board / contributor council
- Long-term infrastructure plan (storage, archival, backups)

---

##  Vision Beyond 2030
The BLSC aims to become:
- the **national standard** for Bulgarian language resources;  
- a backbone for educational, scientific, and cultural projects;  
- a foundation for modern Bulgarian AI models;  
- a permanent digital heritage project for the Bulgarian language.
