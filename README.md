**Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus – Core Dataset and Structure**

The Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC) is a long-term, community-driven, open-source initiative dedicated to the preservation, digitization, and computational modeling of the Bulgarian language and script.


1. Overview
The Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC) is a community-driven, open-source effort to build the largest standardized corpus of contemporary and historical Bulgarian texts.

Its purpose is to:
provide a genuine Bulgarian dataset for language models, NLP tools, and AI research;
offer open, structured, high-quality resources for researchers, students, institutions, and developers;

support the long-term preservation of Bulgarian linguistic and cultural heritage in digital form.

2. Mission
1. Preservation of Bulgarian written heritage in a digital environment.


2. Creation of a large-scale corpus for AI and NLP.


3. Standardization of formats, metadata, and dataset structure.


4. Support for education, academia, and open research.


5. Integration of Bulgarian language resources into global open-source ecosystems.
