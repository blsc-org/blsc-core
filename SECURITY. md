# Security Policy

The Bulgarian Language & Script Corpus (BLSC) project is committed to maintaining a safe and reliable ecosystem for researchers, developers, and contributors.

Although this project does not deal with executable code in the traditional sense, security considerations are still important — especially for data provenance, integrity, and metadata accuracy.
